        <h3><ul><li>About 3.4 million cats enter animal shelters nationwide every year. Approximately 1.4 of the 3.4 million adoptable cats face euthanasia.</li>

<li>According to the ASPCA, less than 5% of cats who enter shelters are returned to their original owners, 37% of shelter cats are adopted, and 41% are euthanized.</li>

<li>The ASPCA estimates between 74-96 million cats are companion animals in the United States.</li>

<li>Fertile cats can produce one to two litters a year with anywhere from four to six kittens per litter.</li>

<li>Male cats have a higher risk of urinary tract and kidney problems. They need plenty of cool, fresh water to help keep those systems healthy.</ul></h3>
